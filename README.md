**Description:**
- Developed Python codes on Jupyter Notebooks that perform sport analytics for baseball. 
- Extracted and manipulated data from existing file containing records of baseball teams over many years.
- Explored basic statistics and data distribution of the dataset; found relationships between variables using statistics, hypothesis testing, and graphs.
- Developed and evaluated different machine learning models to predict a team's chance of win and chance of making to playoffs based on the given parameters.
- Tools used: *python, pandas, scipy.stats, numpy, matplotlib, sklearn*
